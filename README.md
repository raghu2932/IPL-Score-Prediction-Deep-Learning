**IPL-Score-Prediction-Deep-Learning**
This repository implements a deep learning model to predict cricket match scores using historical IPL data. The model analyzes features like team performance, player statistics, and pitch conditions to make accurate predictions.

**Project Outline:**

**Data Acquisition:** Loads historical IPL match data (2008-2017) containing details like venue, team names, batsman/bowler information, and scores.

**Data Preprocessing:**
Cleans the data by dropping irrelevant features and handling missing values.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Encodes categorical features and scales numerical features for model compatibility.

**Model Building:** Defines a neural network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras suitable for regression tasks.

**Model Training:** Trains the model on the prepared training data, tracking loss values for evaluation.

**Model Evaluation:** Uses the trained model to predict scores on the testing set and analyzes the results.

**Interactive Prediction:** Creates a user interface (e.g., using ipywidgets) to accept user input (venue, teams, players) and display predicted scores based on the model's learnings.

**Benefits:**
Enhances understanding of factors influencing match scores.
Offers an interactive tool for fans to predict scores based on player and venue specifics.

**Note:**
For more advanced usage, explore techniques like hyperparameter tuning, model ensembling, and feature engineering.
